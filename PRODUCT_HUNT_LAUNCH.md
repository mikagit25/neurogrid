# Product Hunt Launch Materials

This document includes the Product Hunt launch materials:

- **PRODUCT_HUNT_LAUNCH.md**: Contains all necessary information for the launch.
- **Placeholder SVG Assets**: Includes SVG files for product representation.
- **Asset Generation Script**: Located in `product-hunt/generate_assets.sh`, this script can be used to generate final raster assets.

To generate final raster assets, run the script in a Linux environment with the following tools installed:

- **rsvg-convert**
- **ffmpeg**
- **imagemagick**
- (Optional) **Python gTTS**

Please review the assets and run the generation script if you want real PNG/WebP/GIF/MP4 outputs. Merge when ready!
