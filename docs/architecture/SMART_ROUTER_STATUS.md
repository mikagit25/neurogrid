## 🌐 Production Deployment Ready

### Domain Configuration
- **Development:** `http://localhost:8080`
- **Production:** `https://neurogrid.network` (ready)
- **Staging:** `https://staging.neurogrid.network` (configured)

### Key Endpoints
- `GET /` - Smart Router Dashboard (Main Product)
- `GET /admin.html` - Admin Panel & Configuration
- `GET /mvp` - Legacy MVP Landing Page  
- `GET /health` - System Status with Smart Router statistics
- `POST /api/ai/process` - AI Task Processing
- `GET /api/router/stats` - Real-time Router Statistics

## 💡 Smart Coordinator Selection Logic

The Smart Router intelligently selects coordinators based on:

1. **Task Type Analysis** - Code generation vs explanations vs complex analysis
2. **Complexity Assessment** - Low/medium/high complexity routing
3. **Performance History** - Success rates and response times
4. **Cost Optimization** - Cost-per-request balancing
5. **Load Balancing** - Even distribution across available coordinators

## 🔧 Admin Configuration

Via the Admin Panel users can:
- Configure OpenAI API keys
- Configure Anthropic API keys  
- Test external API connections
- Monitor real-time statistics
- View coordinator performance metrics
- Adjust routing preferences

## 🎯 User Experience

**Main Page Evolution:**
- **Before:** Simple MVP landing page
- **After:** Full Smart Router Dashboard with real-time statistics

Users now see the complete product capabilities immediately, with Smart Router statistics, coordinator status, and task processing metrics prominently displayed.
